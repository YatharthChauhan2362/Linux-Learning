## Linux

- Linux is a free and open-source operating system that was developed in the early 1990s by Linus Torvalds.
- It is based on the Unix operating system and is used on a wide variety of computer hardware, including desktop computers, servers, and mobile devices.

- Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility.
- It is used by millions of people around the world, and is the foundation for many other operating systems, such as Android, which is used on most smartphones.

- One of the key features of Linux is that it is open-source, which means that the source code is freely available to anyone who wants to modify it or use it in their own projects.
- This has made Linux a popular choice for developers and has led to the creation of a large number of different Linux distributions, each with its own unique features and characteristics.
