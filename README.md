## **What is Linux?**

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that was developed in the early 1990s by Linus Torvalds. It is based on the Unix operating system and is used on a wide variety of computer hardware, including desktop computers, servers, and mobile devices.

Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility. It is used by millions of people around the world, and is the foundation for many other operating systems, such as Android, which is used on most smartphones.

One of the key features of Linux is that it is open-source, which means that the source code is freely available to anyone who wants to modify it or use it in their own projects. This has made Linux a popular choice for developers and has led to the creation of a large number of different Linux distributions, each with its own unique features and characteristics.
